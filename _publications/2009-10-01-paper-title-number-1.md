Observed the activation values of all samples at a given layer with almost identical rank through experiments, and thus optimized the model with better performance on public dataset. Found that filter with a large rank contained more information, and utilized this character to prune neural networks, surpassing many other state-of-the-art methods on the performance of the pruned model.
